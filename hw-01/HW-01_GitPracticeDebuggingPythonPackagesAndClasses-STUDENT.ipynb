The hope is that this new class will make it easier for folks who are new to the team to do some basic exploratory data analysis when presented with new project data. \n",

    "Your team leader figured that this was a good opportunity to try using one of the new generative AI tools that are out there to help with the initial development of this new class. Your team leader used [Claude](https://claude.ai/) to generate the starting point for this class, using the following prompt:\n",

    "> Can you provide an example of a python class that would be useful for someone working in a computational modeling and data analysis context?\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, this is a pretty vague prompt. Regardless, your team now has a basic starting point to work from and your team leader wants to move forward with this idea. He has provided you with the following code that was generated by Claude. **Review the code and try running it. Make sure you understand what this code is doing.**"

The distribution looks very similar, with a big cluster of earthquakes with lower magnitudes and only a few with higher magnitudes. This shows that earthquakes with a lot of energy are not as common as those with less energy.*"
